# ScrumAtPlay

### Development

React-Native development requires a number of tools to be installed and configured on your machine for the bundler and simulators to run properly.

If you have never worked on a native app before- you'll need to follow the directions for setting up a project using the [React-Native CLI Quickstart](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies).

Once you've configured your machine for React-Native development- getting the scrum@play app to build should only require a few steps:

1.  Fork the repo
1.  Install dependencies (`yarn` or `npm i`)
1.  Run the web: `yarn run web`
